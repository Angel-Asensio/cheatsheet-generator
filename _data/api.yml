      - title: Data Sources
        sub-title: A data source is a system where data is retrieved from. You can query systems such as distributed object storage, RDBMS, NoSQL databases, document databases, and many others.
      - title:
      - title: Catalogs
        sub-title: Catalogs define and name the configuration to connect to and query a data source
      - title:
      - title: Connectors
        sub-title: A connector translates the query and storage concepts of an underlying data source, such as a relational database management system (RDBMS), object storage, or a key-value store, to the SQL and Trino concepts of tables, columns, rows and data types. These can be simple SQL-to-SQL translations and mappings, but also much more complicated translations from SQL to object storage or NoSQL systems.

      - title:
        sub-title: Trino supports statistics based optimizations for queries. For a query to take advantage of these optimizations, Trino must have statistical information for the tables in that query. Table statistics are provided to the query planner by connectors. 
      - title:
      - title: SHOW STATS
      - title: SHOW STATS FOR table
      - title: SHOW STATS FOR (query)
      - title: 
        sub-title: Returns approximated statistics for the named table or for the results of a query. Returns NULL for any statistics that are not populated or unavailable on the data source.

      - title: ANALYZE
      - title: ANALYZE table_name [WITH (property_name = expression [, ...])]
      - title: 
        sub-title: Collects table and column statistics for a given table. The optional WITH clause can be used to provide connector-specific properties.
